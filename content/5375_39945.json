Torching sub-alpine fir trees caused spot fires on the western edge of the fire that grew to a 300 acre area outside of the primary containment line. Indirect lines will be identified, constructed and used to contain this new fire edge. The uncontained fire has the potential to move toward Highway 12. The fire moved approximately 3 miles to the east in the North Fork of Sweeney Creek. Helicopters dropped retardant on the ridge to check the fire at the mouth of Sweeney Creek and firefighters were successful in holding that line.</font></p><p><font size=\"5\"> </font></p><p><font size=\"5\">Monitor and patrol status continues on the north and northeast sides of the fire. Mop up began in the One Horse drainage and preparations for burnout operations were completed in Sweeney Creek. The burnout will connect previously burned areas forming a continuous buffer along the southeast side of the fire. </font></p><p><font size=\"5\"> </font></p><p><font size=\"5\">Suppression repair work continues to repair areas damaged during earlier phases of fire control efforts. Members of the National Guard are present to support the Ravalli County Sheriff\u2019s Department in providing security at the existing road blocks. </font></p><p><b><font size=\"5\"> </font></b></p><p><font size=\"5\"><b>Today</b>: Crews will focus on Upper and Lower Sweeney Creek while they continue to assess areas for opportunities to mitigate risk and engage in suppression activities to stay ahead of the interior fire front. The high pressure system has moved over the fire and changing winds are expected throughout the day. Fire is expected to be active in areas that have not been exposed to wind recently. The public may see isolated tree torching from deep inside the fire line as wind kicks up flames that consume unburned pockets of fuel. Air support for the fire will be limited due poor visibility until the inversion lifts. </font></p><p><font size=\"5\"> </font></p><p><font size=\"5\"><b>Please do not stop along the highways to view fire activity</b>. It creates a significant traffic hazard, impedes firefighter traffic, and impacts the safety of firefighters and citizens. </font></p><p><b><font size=\"5\"> </font></b></p><p><font size=\"5\"><b>Firewise</b>: For information on how to improve the chances of your homes and structures surviving a wildfire, visit the Firewise website at <a href=\"http://www.firewise.org/\">www.Firewise.org</a>.</font></p><p><font size=\"5\"> </font></p><font size=\"5\"><b>Evacuation/Closure Information</b>: Evacuations and road closures are based upon the need to provide for safety of the public and firefighters, current fire behavior, forecasted weather, and planned suppression operations. Fire officials, Missoula and Ravalli County Sheriff\u2019s Offices, and Montana Department of Transportation will evaluate the evacuation and road closures daily.
