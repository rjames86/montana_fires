Fire staff will work on building a machine and hand line ahead of the southwest edge of the fire to protect the East Fork Bitterroot structures. Structure protection efforts will continue here, at Frog Pond, Moose Lake, and other isolated buildings. Crews will continue burn out operations to reduce unburned fuels between the fire and the Frog Pond area. Because of the potential for increased fire activity along the east side, the Moose Lake community will be a main focus of attention today.</font> </p> <font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font> <p><font size=\"2\"><b>Evacuations: </b>The Frog Pond area is under an evacuation order.
