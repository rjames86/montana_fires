By evening Aug 30, the fire has grown to an estimated 1000 acres. The Forest Service will conduct an infrared detection flight overnight to determine the new size and perimeter of the fire. Today firefighters reinforced fire line on the northern edge to prevent movement toward structures and other resources of value. Air tankers laid down a line of fire retardant along the south edge of Road 7581 to increase the road\u2019s effectiveness as a fireline. Firefighters using helicopter bucket drops successfully knocked down a spot fire that had become established north of the road. <b> </b> <b>Resources: </b>Heavy air tankers and helicopters were instrumental in moderating spread of the fire to allow work on contingency lines between the fire and homes to the north. Excavators worked to clear roads for use as firelines. More personnel will be assigned to the fire as they are released from other fires in the area. Firefighting resources, both equipment and people, are being moved among separate fires to protect the highest values at risk. <b> </b> <b>Structures: </b>This fire does not directly threaten structures currently, but pre-evacuation notices have been issued to residents along River Road West. Residents in areas under warning notice should be prepared to evacuate with very little additional notice.<b></b> <b> </b> <b>Hazards: </b>Steep, rocky terrain. Access to much of the fire area is difficult. The forest fuels feeding the fire are at near-record dryness, and low humidity and wind have made all Montana fires extremely dangerous and rapidly moving. <b>If you fly, we can\u2019t! </b>The use of unmanned aircraft (drones) is illegal near forest fires and can force the grounding of firefighting aircraft, jeopardize firefighter and pilot safety and impede successful suppression. Please, don\u2019t be the person that helps this fire escape. <b> </b> <b>Closures: </b>Road Nos. 7583 and 7589, and Road No. 217 after the junction with 7589 are closed. Trails 385 (Sacajawea Peak), 398 (Dee Creek) and 1400 (West Fork of Swamp Creek) are also closed.
