Saturday evening, several wind shifts and strong wind gusts threw multiple spot fires across containment lines near the convergence of the South Fork of the Jocko River and Liberty Creek. 16 firefighters became entrapped by flame, 13 were able to escape to a safety zone while 3 began to deploy fire shelters. Another wind shift provided the 3 with the opportunity to escape to safety. All firefighters are safe, and there were no injuries reported.
