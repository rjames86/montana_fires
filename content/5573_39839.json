On Friday, September 1st the two fires burned together along a small section of the Tongue River Road. Aviation resources flew the fires yesterday and determined the fire is 6,393 acres in size. The Snider fire was reported around 12:00 PM on Thursday, August 31 and the cause is natural. The fire is 16 miles east of Colstrip, MT and started on private land. Rosebud fire warden, local ranchers and some heavy equipment worked hard for days to slow the progress of the fire. Currently a Type 1 Hot Shot crew is working the Snider Fire. The priority today is to secure the SE and S sides of the fire, continue to build and improve line, burn out areas of unburned line as conditions and resources allow and mop-up 200 feet in from the fire perimeter. <br/></font><br/> <br/><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"3\">RESOURCES: <br/> <b>22 Engines <br/> 5 Crews </b><b>(4 Type 2 Initial Attack 20 person crews and 1 Type 1 Hot Shot 20 person crew) <br/> 11 Heavy Equipment </b><b>(5 dozers, 3 skidgines, 3 water tender)</b></font> </p><p style=\"margin-left:0in;\"> <font face=\"Arial\" size=\"3\"><b>212 Total Personnel</b></font> <br/> </p><p style=\"margin-left:0in;\"> </p> <br/></p>\n</div>", "guidislink": false, "title_detail": {"base": "", "type": "text/plain", "value": "Sunday, September 3 Morning Update (Sartin Draw Fire Wildfire)", "language": null}, "link": "https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/5573/39839/", "published": "Sun, 03 Sep 2017 10:59:00 -05:00", "article_id": "39839", "id": "https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/5573/39839/"}
