Firing operations were conducted to remove unburned fuels along the perimeter between the Morrel Lookout and the Cottonwood Lakes road. The southwest fire perimeter continued to back downhill towards the road in the Cottonwood Lakes area. Crews began mopping up spot fires which have been detected south of the Cottonwood Lakes road and mop up operations were conducted to cool hot spots inside the perimeter north of the Cottonwood Lakes road and west of the Little Shanley Creek road. </font></font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 6pt 0in 6pt 5pt;\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font size=\"3\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">Planned Actions:</b> The northwestern flank of the fire will be re-assessed to determine suitable indirect line locations. In the Morrell Creek drainage, crews will work to mop up and improve fire lines from yesterday\u2019s firing operations. The area will be gridded to search for additional spots that may be in the area. Crews will look for opportunities to conduct firing operations to reduce fuels and improve fire line conditions north of Cottonwood Lakes Road and along the northwest fire perimeter. The Cottonwood Lakes road will be monitored for spotting activity south of the road. Crews will assess the road in Black Canyon for opportunities to conduct firing operations to check the fire\u2019s eastward progress. Heavy equipment will be utilized to remove fuels and improve line along the Cottonwood Lakes road east of current fire perimeter. Two Type 1 and one Type 3 helicopters will be assigned to the fire for conducting water drops and aerial observation today Structure protection efforts will continue in the Double Arrow Ranch, Hwy 83 corridor and Kozy Korner areas.</font></font></font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 6pt 5.05pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 99%;\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font size=\"3\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">Evacuations</b>: <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">The Missoula County Sheriff has issued multiple evacuation ORDERS and WARNINGS.</b> The current map and description is posted on </font></font><a href=\"https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/5414/39277/\"><font color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"3\">Inciweb</font></a><font color=\"#000000\"><font size=\"3\">.
