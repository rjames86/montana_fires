Suppression repair activities along the western section of the fire were temporarily suspended due to an aggressive grizzly bear encounter a few days ago. The fire had become more active along the northern sections of the fire. A hotshot crew and several engines along with helicopters making bucket drops were working the northwest section of the fire line slowing the fire down as it approached containment lines. Elsewhere along the fire in southeast corner where the fire had been burning most intensely the past week, crews continued to mop up and extend black line towards the fires interior. </font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\"> </font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\">At approximately 5:00 pm area wide weather and extremely dry fuels culminated in events that caused significant fire spread not only on the Liberty Fire, but almost all the wild fires burning in Western Montana. According to data from several of the incident Weather Stations, relative humidities suddenly dropped to 10%, which indicated that a wedge of dry air rapidly passed through the region. This event coupled with the complex topography created a sudden series of widely variable wind shifts and gusts on the Liberty Fire.</font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\"> </font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\">On the Northwest corner of the fire where Liberty Creek joins into the South Fork of the Jocko River a sudden change in wind created hundreds of spot fires across firelines. The Division Supervisor for that section of fire line gave crews orders to disengage from firefighting efforts and retreat to designated Safety Zones. Thirteen of these firefighters were able to follow their escape routes to a safety zone. Two firefighters and a Line Safety Officer discovered their primary safety route was cut off by heavy smoke and flames from multiple spot fires. They made the decision to deploy fire shelters, and just as they started to do so a fortunate shift in the wind cleared the smoke away long enough to provide a way out to a Safety Zone. All 16 firefighters made their way to safety under their own power uninjured. </font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\"> </font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\">In the Southeastern section of the fire, the burning out operations were progressing well and burning back toward the interior of the main body of the fire, consuming pockets of unburnt and partially burnt fuels as it extended a clean burn in ever increasing depth away from firelines. That was until the same weather conditions occurred, bending the heavy smoke columns over and blowing embers and flaming brands across the firelines in multiple locations. This resulted in numerous spot fires and an eventual breach of containment lines in multiple locations. Fire crews pulled back and regrouped as three SEATs, Single Engine<b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"> </b>Air Tankers, were brought in to make multiple retardant drops to slow down the fire front. A Type Two Initial Attack hand crew remained near the fireline overnight to monitor and hold the fire where they could. </font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\"> </font><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><font color=\"#000000\"> </font></b></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">Today: </b>A Red Flag Warning goes into effect today from noon to 9:00 pm with predictions of even warmer temperatures and lower relative humidities forecast. Additionally, firefighters are working in extremely dry fuel conditions for dead and down trees with the large logs/trees, thousand-hour fuels, at 7-8% moisture content. To put that into perspective, kiln dried lumber has a 13-15% moisture content. All of this coupled with extreme mid and upper atmosphere instability is creating a Red Flag Warning situation on steroids, so to speak, for fire crews.</font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\"> </font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\">With limited resources crews and managers will work to develop options to contain the slop over/breakout series of fires in the northwest section today with managers scouting out new potential containment line locations that will provide the highest degree of success holding the fire within safety and resource concerns.</font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\"> </font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\">Crews will continue to patrol and mop up in depth along the Northeastern and Eastern sides of the fire where the lines successfully held, while in the Southeastern section crews and managers work to flank the fire that jumped lines as they develop and begin construction of new containment and contingency lines.</font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\"> </font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\">Finally, Suppression Repair crew members underwent bear spray training and were issued cans of bear repellent before returning to resume fireline repair actions along the western side of the fire this morning.</font><br/> </p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\"> </font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font size=\"3\"> <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"> </b></font><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">Resources on the Fire: 5</b> 20-person crews, <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">9</b> engines, <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">2 </b>helicopters, <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">5</b> bulldozers, <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">6 </b>skidgines, 1<b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">0</b> water tenders, Total: <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">425</b></font><br/> </p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\" size=\"3\"> </font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font size=\"3\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><font color=\"#000000\"> Wildfires are a No Drone Zone.
