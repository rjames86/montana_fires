However, the wind direction, while primarily from the Southwest were mainly terrain driven and thus shifted around from valley to valley. The result was they nudged the fire back away from the Southeastern containment lines rather than pressing it against them. Firefighters continued to improve and strengthen defensive positions as the fire intensity and the danger of burning embers being blown across firelines were both greatly reduced. The variable terrain driven winds created renewed fire activity along portions of the Northern sections of the fireline. Engine crews and helicopter bucket drops slowed the fire down as it made its way North towards Liberty Creek. The lower intensity fire activity in the Southeastern section allowed crews to initiate a hand firing-out operation at 4 pm to remove a 300-yardwide pocket of unburnt fuel between containment lines. The burn operation was completed successfully by 7 pm yesterday evening. <br/><br/>Today:<br/> With a new high-pressure system building and moving into the area winds continue to be out of the Southwest and terrain driven, but will be shifting around to the East this evening. The continued terrain driven winds have changed the main direction of fire travel and peak activity, and reduced the danger of embers being blown across containment lines to start spot fires along the Southern and Southeastern portions of the fire perimeter. Firelines along the critical Southeast corner of the fire will be strengthened as crews add greater depth to the containment lines and continue to mop up and patrol them. The same holds true along the Eastern portion of the Southern containment line into the 2003 MineralPrimm burn scar with crews planning to do a final short 200-foot-long hand-firing operation along a section of the line as they finish locking down and holding the fire in place along the Northern side of Gold Creek. However, with the change in wind direction, the fire has become much more active along the Northwestern and Northern portions of the firelines. Resources are being shifted around to finish holding and locking the fire in place along the Western end of the North containment line. Further East along the line fire managers will be working to slow down the fire\u2019s activity as it approaches the Southern riparian areas along Liberty Creek. The Montana National Guard has activated a Blackhawk helicopter and crew to add to the state\u2019s firefighting resources. The Air Guard crew has been assigned to the Liberty Fire for training and practice working wildfire operations, and will become part of today\u2019s aerial firefighting efforts.<br/><br/> Resources on the Fire: 7 20-person crews, 2 helicopters, 12 engines, 6 bulldozers, 6 skidgines, 9 water tenders, Total: 478 <br/><br/>Wildfires are a No Drone Zone. If you fly, we can\u2019t. Every time a drone is spotted near the fire all aircraft are grounded until we can be sure the drone is clear of this area.<br/><br/> For more information visit Know Before You Fly, https://knowbeforeyoufly.org For more information on all fires burning on the Lolo National Forest, log in to their Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/lolonationalforest/</font></p>\n</div>", "guidislink": false, "title_detail": {"base": "", "type": "text/plain", "value": "Liberty Fire Update 9/2/17 (Liberty Fire Wildfire)", "language": null}, "link": "https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/5437/39751/", "published": "Sat, 02 Sep 2017 11:58:00 -05:00", "article_id": "39751", "id": "https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/5437/39751/"}
