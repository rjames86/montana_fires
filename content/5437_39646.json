Opposingly, where there has been so much fire activity for the last few days, Division Mike, Tango and Uniform are experiencing less heat, so mop up work in those areas progressed.</font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\"> </font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\">On the North side, the BAER team hydrologists actively assessed the area for restoration needs. The containment line on the East side was secure, although interior fuels were actively burning. The Suppression Repair crew continued chipping along Jocko dip road. On the South side crews continued to monitor and hold the dozer line into the Mineral-Primm Fire scar. Crews completed two and a half miles of the hose lay on the Southeast corner, and worked to chain in from the indirect containment line.</font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\"> </font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt;\"><font color=\"#000000\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">Today: </b>Cleaner, clearer air is predicted for air ops today. The BAER Team will continue conducting their evaluations for restoration requirements.
