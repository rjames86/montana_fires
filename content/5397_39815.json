The McCart lookout is nearly complete with foil wrapping. The indirect line near Zeke\u2019s meadow is also nearly complete in preparation for possible burnout in the future. Conditions were favorable in the Frog Pond area for burnout operations in green areas of the fire and helicopters were able to drop water on areas to slow the growth in other areas. Structure protection is still a priority for Moose Lake. A packer bridge sustained some railing damage from fire, but remains serviceable. Sprinklers were set on the bridges to prevent any further damage. Helicopters made 156 water drops, but had to stop operations later in the day because of high winds. </font></font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 4pt 0in;\"><font size=\"2\"><font color=\"#000000\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">Current Resources: Three</b> 20-person crews, <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">seventeen</b> engines, <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">four</b> pieces of heavy equipment (dozers, masticators), <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">ten </b>water tenders, and <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">three</b> helicopters.

A Red Flag warning has been issued and will remain in effect till 9 p.m. tonight. With temperatures 20 degrees above normal, extremely low humidity, sustained winds with gusts, significant fire growth is forecasted. Expect large smoke plumes. The most intense fire growth is projected in the East Fork of the Bitterroot moving east. Smoke from the fire activity in the East Fork Bitterroot will influence the progression of fire east of Moose Lake Road. Across the fire, point protection for structures will remain the priority. Crews will grid for spot fire on the east side of Moose Lake Road (FS Road 5106) to keep the fire west of the road north of Moose Lake. Hand and machine line construction is expected to start from the East Fork Road. The indirect line near Zeke\u2019s Meadow will be improved today with a 20 person hot shot crew. </font></font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 4pt 0in;\"><font size=\"2\"><font color=\"#000000\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">Evacuations: </b>The Frog Pond area is under an evacuation order.
