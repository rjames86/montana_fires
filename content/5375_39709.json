Helicopters worked to reduce the intensity of the fire as it slowly worked down the slope south of One Horse Creek by dropping small fire-starting spheres that initiate controlled fire once they hit the ground. </font></p> <p><font size=\"5\"> </font></p> <p><font size=\"5\">Smoke and fire was visible throughout the area due to fire activity in the One Horse Drainage, the upper end of Sweeney Creek, the South Fork of Lolo Creek, and the northwestern side of the fire where it continues to clean out pockets of timber that were previously unburned. </font></p> <p><font size=\"5\"> </font></p> <p><font size=\"5\">Mop up continues on the north and northwest sides of the fire, patrolling and monitoring continue on the east side . Suppression repair work has begun to repair areas damaged during suppression on the northwest side of the fire. In anticipation of increased traffic and numbers of visitors in the area over the Labor Day weekend, 54 members of the National Guard arrived in the afternoon to support the Ravalli County Sheriff\u2019s Department providing security at the existing road blocks. </font></p> <p><font size=\"5\"> </font></p> <p><font size=\"5\"><b>Today</b>: Fire is expected to be less active today in the One Horse drainage where the fire is burning in mixed conifer fuels. The public may see isolated tree torching from deep inside the fire line as wind kicks up flames that continue to consume unburned pockets of fuel. A burnout operation is planned on the north side of Sweeney Creek when conditions allow. Burnout operations help the fire to progress in a slow, deliberate manner. Firefighters will continue to bring the fire down to the areas that have already burned in order to slow the fire\u2019s growth in a controlled manner. Smoke will be visible from Florence and Hwy 93.</font></p> <p><font size=\"5\"> </font></p> <p><font size=\"5\"><b>Please do not stop along the highways to view fire activity</b>. It creates a significant traffic hazard, impedes firefighter traffic, impacts the safety of firefighters and citizens. </font></p> <p><b><font size=\"5\"> </font></b></p> <p><font size=\"5\"><b>Firewise</b>: For information on how to improve the chances of your homes and structures surviving a wildfire, visit the Firewise website at <a href=\"http://www.firewise.org/\">www.Firewise.org</a>.</font></p> <p><font size=\"5\"> </font></p> <font size=\"5\"><b>Evacuation/Closure Information</b>: Evacuations and road closures are based upon the need to provide for safety of the public and firefighters, current fire behavior, forecasted weather, and planned suppression operations.
