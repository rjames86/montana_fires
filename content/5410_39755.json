When wind is favorable, a handcrew is slowly working their way east along a logging road with drip torches to clean up edges of the fire. This will enforce containment of the fire. From the \u201cHunting Lodge\u201d, a dozer is beginning to work north, constructing a dozer line following the Falls Creek Ridge (drainage to Dearborn Creek). <br/></font><br/> </font></font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"'Times New Roman'\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 9pt 0pt 0in;\"><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"'Times New Roman'\" size=\"3\"> </font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"'Times New Roman'\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 9pt 0pt 0in;\"><font face=\"'Times New Roman'\"><font size=\"3\"><font color=\"#000000\">Feller bunchers working with engines have been widening a road system that curves in a half circle from Bedrock Creek to the North Fork of Green Creek (does not include the south fork of Green Creek). Firefighters are cooperating with ranchers and other landowners adjacent to the fire area to share information and evolving plans that may affect their property if winds push the fire directly east. These conversations are essential to all involved as firefighters are highly sensitive to their concerns, and understand the fire is threatening the essence of their livelihoods. Firefighters, landowners, emergency response personnel, including the Wolf Creek fire responders and law enforcement, are participating in this contingency planning that may involve laying fire on the ground. These ongoing conversations will ensure the safety of firefighters and landowners and keep communication channels open. Fire managers wish to ensure these targeted landowners understand who is performing the activities, how they will occur and for what purpose. <br/></font><br/> </font></font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"'Times New Roman'\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 9pt 0pt 0in;\"><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"'Times New Roman'\" size=\"3\"> </font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"'Times New Roman'\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 9pt 0pt 0in;\"><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"'Times New Roman'\" size=\"3\">Structure protection equipment are also in the southeast flank of the fire (Elk Meadow/Evergreen community) and the northern flank of the fire (Dearborn community) working with affected landowners.</font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"'Times New Roman'\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 9pt 0pt 0in;\"><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"'Times New Roman'\" size=\"3\"> </font></p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"'Times New Roman'\" size=\"3\"> </font><p style=\"margin: 0in 9pt 0pt 0in;\"><font face=\"'Times New Roman'\"><font size=\"3\"><font color=\"#000000\">Along the southeastern flank, two feller bunchers and crews are strengthened the line from the road in Green Creek to Lewis and Clark Pass to Bedrock Creek.
