This is a full suppression fire. With the fire containment at 85%, the values at risk that included the electronic sites, active mining operations, and residence and cattle ranch operations along the Highway 69 corridor are significantly lessened. Also, the concern for the structures in the Antelope Lane area is significantly lessened and our active presence will diminish. Fire managers have now placed the north, east, south and most of the west flanks of the fire in a monitor and patrol status. Fire line rehabilitation efforts are mostly done and will continue on all contained portions of the fire. </font><br/> </p></font><font face=\"Arial\"><p><font size=\"3\"><b>Yesterday:</b> The containment lines were again tested substantially by fairly strong, erratic winds all day. Fire managers\u2019 reported that containment lines held well on all flanks. Two spike camps on the western flank of fire continue to be used by four crews plus overhead to reduce travel time. </font><br/> </p></font><font face=\"Arial\"><p><font size=\"3\"><b>Today:</b> An IR flight last night revealed some hot spots well inside the interior that crews will search for and extinguish today. Crews based out of the spike camps are working from both directions on the west flank in upper Conrow Creek to connect the final portion of necessary containment line on the fire. As part of the monitor and patrol activities, engine crews will continue mop-up actions along completed containment lines, patrol for hot spots and conduct identified rehabilitation work. Helicopters will be available to support ground-based efforts with water bucket drops to lessen heat on all flanks. There will be some demobing of excess resources as the fire threat diminishes. </font></p></font><font face=\"Arial\"><p><br/><font size=\"3\"><b>Weather</b>: A Red Flag Warning has been issued by the National Weather Service for stronger mid-level and valley winds to 20 mph. Temperatures will be lower in the mid 80\u2019s with RH\u2019s higher in the 20% range. Ridgetop winds will be northwest/west 10-20 mph. </font></p></font><p><br/><font face=\"Arial\"><font size=\"3\"><b>Evacuations or Closures:</b> There are no area, trail or road closures. <u>Stage I Fire restrictions</u> will be amended to prohibit all campfires effective September 2, 2017 so refer to </font></font><a href=\"www.firerestrictions.us\" target=\"_blank\"><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"3\">www.firerestrictions.us</font></a><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"3\"> for details. <br/><br/><b>Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR)</b>: A TFR encompasses the fire area.
