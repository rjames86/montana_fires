The warning is lifted in the Highway 12 corridor from mile marker 24 (near and including Arena Drive) to the Highway 93 junction in Lolo. The evacuation warning was also lifted for residents in the Highway 93 corridor from the Highway 12 junction to mile marker 79 (near and including the Gravel Pit off of Old Highway 93 and the McClain Creek Road). </font></p><p><font size=\"5\"> </font></p><p><font size=\"5\">The evacuation warning remains in place in the Bear Creek and Elk Creek areas on Highway 12 east of Lolo and in the Highway 93 corridor from McClain Creek Road south to Bass Creek Road.

Aircraft and engines took direct suppression actions on the fire which continued through the night. Firefighters continued to reinforce the strategically burned out buffer areas connecting One Horse and Sweeney Creek drainages with support from Helicopters. </font></p><p><font size=\"5\"> </font></p><p><font size=\"5\">Smoke and fire was visible throughout the area due to increased fire activity in the South Fork of Lolo Creek, the One Horse Drainage, the upper end of Sweeney Creek, and the northwestern side of the fire where it continues to work through pockets of timber that were previously unburned. Patrolling, monitoring and mop up efforts continue on the north, northwest and northeast sides of the fire. Fire progression is being actively monitored on the southwestern edge.</font></p><p><font size=\"5\"> </font></p><p><font size=\"5\">Suppression repair work is occurring to repair areas damaged during earlier phases of fire control efforts. Members of the National Guard continue to support the Ravalli County Sheriff\u2019s Department providing security at the existing road blocks. </font></p><p><b><font size=\"5\"> </font></b></p><p><font size=\"5\"><b>Today</b>: Fire is expected to be active today in the One Horse and Sweeney Creek drainages. The public may see isolated tree torching from deep inside the fire line as wind kicks up flames that consume unburned pockets of fuel. </font></p><p><font size=\"5\">As a result of the red flag conditions, these areas are expected to produce significant amounts of smoke, and smoke columns will be visible from the Highway 93 corridor. Nearby fires in northern Idaho and western Montana will also be experiencing increased activity brining more smoke into the area.</font></p><p><font size=\"5\"> </font></p><p><font size=\"5\"><b>Please do not stop along the highways to view fire activity</b>. It creates a significant traffic hazard, impedes firefighter traffic, and impacts the safety of firefighters and citizens. </font></p><p><b><font size=\"5\"> </font></b></p><p><font size=\"5\"><b>Firewise</b>: For information on how to improve the chances of your homes and structures surviving a wildfire, visit the Firewise website at <a href=\"http://www.firewise.org/\">www.Firewise.org</a>.</font></p><p><font size=\"5\"> </font></p><font size=\"5\"><b>Evacuation/Closure Information</b>: Evacuations and road closures are based upon the need to provide for safety of the public and firefighters, current fire behavior, forecasted weather, and planned suppression operations. Fire officials, Missoula and Ravalli County Sheriff\u2019s Offices, and Montana Department of Transportation will evaluate the evacuation and road closures daily.
