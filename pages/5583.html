On August 29th, firefighters responded to and contained some of these fires. Seven of the fires, however, exceeded their initial attack efforts and have grown in size and severity. These fires include the Moose Peak, Miller Creek, Deep Creek, Reader, Reader 2, Cub Creek, and Sheep Gap Fires. To assist local resources, the Western Montana Type II Incident Management Team took command on Saturday evening and is managing these fires as a complex. Within this complex, the fires of greatest concern are the Sheep Gap and Reader Fires because they pose the most imminent threat to public safety.</p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 8.2pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Outlook: Today will be a critical fire weather day. A Red Flag Warning is in place from 12:00-9:00 PM. High temperatures and low humidity are expected to be record breaking for this time of year. Additionally, the fire area may experience gusty and erratic winds making fire behavior more intense and less predictable. As always, firefighter and public safety remain the top priority. The current management objective is to protect values at risk, such as private property and infrastructure, while utilizing the limited resources most effectively. Available resources, including crews, heavy equipment, and aerial resources are being shared between the fires so they can be utilized where they are most needed and have the highest probability of success. </p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 8.2pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evacuations: The Sanders County Sheriff’s Office is individually notifying residents within evacuation zones. As conditions change, the Sheriff’s Office will be notifying affected residents by phone. So far, they have ordered several pre-evacuation warnings and implemented evacuations near the Sheep Gap Fire. East of Plains, mandatory evacuations are in place from the end of River Road West to Arnold Road, at the corner of Section 11. All residents in the Plains and Trout Creek areas should note that conditions are dynamic and will likely change quickly over the next few days. Please have an evacuation plan in place NOW for what you would do in the event of an emergency. Wildfires can grow very quickly and you may receive little to no notice before an evacuation takes place. </p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 8.2pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Closures: Area closures are currently in place around the immediate fire areas and areas integral to safe fire operations. As hunting season continues, please respect area closures. The Forest Service is working to ensure that closures are kept to a minimum but are large enough for firefighter and public safety. Please see InciWeb and the Forest Service webpages for the latest closure area maps. </p><br/><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 8.2pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Percent Containment: 0%</p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 8.2pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Size: 3347 acres</p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 8.2pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Personnel: 211</p><br/><br/><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fire Details:</p><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 8.2pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fires are listed in order of management priority, based on threat to values at risk.</p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 8.2pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sheep Gap - 2,224 acres: This fire is currently the top management priority due to its threat to private property and residences. Approximately 70 residences are threatened and have been notified of mandatory evacuations by the Sanders County Sheriff’s Office. Firefighters are continuing to check for and secure spot fires on the northern edge of the fire. They are also working to put structure protection measures in place and establish contingency fire line where possible. Aerial resources will be assisting firefighters on the ground to slow fire spread and suppress any spot fires caused by wind-driven embers. </p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 8.2pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Reader Fires – 139 acres (total): The Reader and Reader 2 fires are being managed conjointly due to their close proximity. Firefighters are working to establish fire line around these two fires and hold the fire line already developed. Wind along the ridgetops will continue to challenge firefighting efforts. As these fires progress, pre-evacuation warnings are being issued to some residents in the areas of White Pine, Beaver Creek, and Little Beaver. All residents, please have an evacuation plan in place now and know what you would do in the event of an emergency. </p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 8.2pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cub Creek – 371 acres: Firefighters will start direct and indirect line construction based on resource availability and priorities within the larger Highway 200 Complex. Much of the area surrounding this fire is roadless and will present access challenges to firefighters. The fire is expected to continue growing to the east, driven by winds. </p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 8.2pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Deep Creek – 529 acres: Firefighters will implement point protection strategies and look for opportunities to utilize direct tactics while minimizing firefighter exposure to hazards. Aircraft will continue to be utilized to keep the fire in check. The Cougar Peak Lookout is currently threatened but structure suppression actions have been implemented. With today’s expected wind there is potential for spot fires over Graves Creek Road and Deep Creek. </p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 8.2pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Moose Creek – 234 acres: This fire is currently unstaffed due to limited resources, however, structure protection specialists assessed the area north of the fire to develop future suppression objectives if needed. </p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 8.2pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Miller Creek – 84 acres: This fire is currently unstaffed due to limited resources. </p><br/></b></p></div><br style="clear: right;"/><h4>Basic Information</h4><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="data" summary="This table displays basic incident information."><tr><th class="cell0" scope="row" style="width: 30%;">Current as of</th><td class="cell3"><script>var clientdate = new Date("2017-09-02T22:52:41-05:00");document.write(clientdate.toLocaleString())</script></td></tr><tr><th class="cell1" scope="row">Incident Type</th><td class="cell2">Wildfire</td></tr><tr><th class="cell1" scope="row">Cause</th><td class="cell2">Natural/ Lightning</td></tr><tr><th class="cell1" scope="row">Date of Origin</th><td class="cell2">Monday August 28th, 2017 approx.   12:00 AM</td></tr><tr><th class="cell1" scope="row">Location</th><td class="cell2">Highway 200 Corridor, near Thompson Falls, MT</td></tr><tr><th class="cell1" scope="row">Incident Commander</th><td class="cell2">Western Montana Incident Management Team,  Incident Commander- Rick Connell</td></tr></table><h4>Current Situation</h4><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="data" summary="This table displays the situation information."><tr><th class="cell0" scope="row" style="width: 30%;">Fuels Involved</th><td class="cell3"><p>Timber/Brush</p></td></tr><tr><th class="cell1" scope="row">Significant Events</th><td class="cell2"><p>Late August 28th, the Plains and Thompson Falls, MT, areas experienced a lightning storm that ignited approximately 20 fires in the area.
