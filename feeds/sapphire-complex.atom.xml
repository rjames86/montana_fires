Such operations may be critical in securing firelines along the fire’s southwest perimeter and protecting structures in that area and will likely continue for one more day. Crews working along the fire’s eastern, western, and southern flanks further improved containment and firelines, mopping up hot spots, working inward from the fire perimeter. Structure protection measures (including extensive hoselays) are still in place along Rock Creek Road. Preventing fire growth toward homes and ranches continues to dictate operational priorities, and protection of life is always the primary objective. &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;font face="Times New Roman" size="3"&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goat Creek Fire: 8,305 acres, 95% contained.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;font face="Times New Roman" size="3"&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Rehabilitation of firelines and fuel break construction is progressing rapidly, and crews continue to mop up hot spots within the fire’s perimeter.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;font face="Times New Roman" size="3"&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Sliderock Fire: 901 acres, 95% contained. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;font face="Times New Roman" size="3"&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;Crews continue to mop up hotspots and patrol the Sliderock Fire, resulting in increased containment.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;font face="Times New Roman" size="3"&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Resources Threatened:&lt;/b&gt; Private property and structures in the Rock Creek, Upper Willow Creek, and Marshall Creek drainages remain threatened. Other resources threatened include fisheries in Rock Creek, grazing lands along the southern boundary of the Little Hogback Fire, Bonneville Power Administration powerline, and a communication site.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;font face="Times New Roman" size="3"&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evacuations:&lt;/b&gt; Three structures in the lower end of Capron Creek, near mile marker 33 on Rock Creek Road remain in Level Red- Evacuation Status. Many homes and communities are still potentially threatened by the fires within the Sapphire Complex, and as a result “Yellow” Pre-evacuation status for those areas also remain in effect. See Inciweb maps and evacuation alerts for details. &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;font face="Times New Roman" size="3"&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Closures: &lt;/b&gt;The Rock Creek Road from I-90 south to Bitterroot Campground (MP 23.5) is OPEN. Due to fire traffic congestion and fire safety concerns, the Rock Creek Road will continue to be CLOSED from Bitterroot Campground, south to Cornish Gulch (FSR5027), and public traffic is NOT allowed. Upper Willow Creek Road is currently closed to the public. The Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest has reduced closure restrictions in the Black Pine ridge area, but maintains all area closures in the Upper Willow Creek, North Fork Lower Willow Creek, and Harvey Creek areas. The Bureau of Land Management has implemented an area closure in the Upper Willow Creek, Ram Mountain, and nearby areas. The Lolo and Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forests and the Bureau of Land Management have posted closure orders and maps under the &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/closures/5364/"&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff" face="Times New Roman"&gt;closures tab&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt; on Inciweb.&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;p style="margin: 6pt 0in; tab-stops: center 3.85in;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weather: &lt;/b&gt; Although winds are predicted to lessen over the fire area today, relative humidities are expected to be very low and temperatures will approach the 90s, which could result in increased fire behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin: 6pt 0in;"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fire Restrictions:&lt;/b&gt; Stage 1 Fire Restrictions are in place on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest (Forest Service land east of Sandstone Ridge), with the additional modification to prohibit all campfires. Stage 2 Fire Restrictions are in place on BLM, private and state lands in Granite County, and the Lolo National Forest (Forest Service land west of Sandstone Ridge). &lt;b&gt;For information on fire restrictions, please visit &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://firerestrictions.us/"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;firerestrictions.us&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p style="margin: 6pt 0in;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin: 6pt 0in;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3"&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
