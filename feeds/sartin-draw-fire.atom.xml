The fire has been progressing to the northeast. Fire resources are working to keep the fire east of the Tongue River, south of the 621 and 664 roads, west of Highway 59 and north of Beaver Creek, Beaver Stacy Roads and Merchant Cut Across. Dozerline is being reinforced with firing operations to increase depth to secure fireline.

They were able to bring additional fire resources with them to assist existing firefighters on the fireline. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Severe drought with hot and windy conditions has given zero relief for firefighters. In addition to the Sartin Draw Fire firefighters have been chasing and suppressing numerous fires in the area for the last seven days from a series of lightning storms that rolled through the area. This is on top of the extremely busy fire season this summer in Eastern Montana, due to severe drought conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evacuations&lt;/b&gt;: Pre-evacuation notice is in place for residents N of Merchant Cut, W of Hwy 59 and S of 674 Road. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt; Fire Statistics:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Size: 80,000 acres &lt;br/&gt;Containment: 0% &lt;br/&gt;Cause: Unknown &lt;br/&gt;Location: 20 miles NE of Ashland, MT &lt;br/&gt;Resources: 27 Engines 3 Crew 7 Heavy Equipment&lt;/p&gt;
