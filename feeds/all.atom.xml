Four lightning strikes hit the Flathead Reservation yesterday and more lightning is possible today.  Red Flag Warnings indicate there is high potential for fire combustion, and for any new or existing fires to spread rapidly. During this period of critical fire weather, firefighters will continue to secure and hold firelines on the Blue Bay Fire, as well as monitor unburned areas outside of containment lines for spot fires. Acreage remains steady at 490 acres but containment has increased to 80 percent.  With the increased potential for rapid fire spread, some resources on the Blue Bay Fire have been identified for initial attack.
